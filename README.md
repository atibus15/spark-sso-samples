# spark-sso-samples
Server-side (Node.JS) and client-side sample apps demonstrating OAuth2 with Cisco Spark REST APIs

The following requirements are needed to edit and run this set of samples:

* **NodeJS & NPM** - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install dependencies.  If you do not have Node/NPM installed, see the following guides:
 * Linux: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-linux
 * Mac: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac
 * Windows: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows  
* **An IDE or developer code editor** - We suggest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which has great support for debugging Node.JS
* **Git** - Source code management and sharing [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
